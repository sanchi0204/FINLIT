# PROBLEM STATEMENT

People with very limited experience in investing may be shocked by the news that an average investor loses 50% of his/her portfolio value if not invested correctly.
There are a some challenges that every investors struggle with, 
These are: 
    * Information Overload
	  * Unknown Risks
	  * Limited Capital
	  * Over-Diversification
	  * Bad Timing
	  * Not Getting Help etc

# SOLUTION
We have developed an “Investment Solution” called FinLit. This application helps the user to manage their investment effectively in order to gain maximum rate of interest.

The user will enter information like ‘the amount to be invested’ , ‘the risk taking capability’ and ‘time period’ to the application.

With the information provided by the user, the application will calculate best investment options from ‘Equity Funds’, ‘Debt Funds’, ‘Public Provident Fund’ , ‘Gold Sovereign Bonds’. After this, the application will provide mixed options to invest to get maximum profit out of it.

The backend model is backed by the machine learning algorithms that will predict the output by  taking certain parameters in consideration:
Inflation at the time of maturity.
Risk taking factor of the user.
Liquidity.

The output data will be displayed to the user through: 
Portfolio of investment options: Pie Chart
The predicted amount they will be investing in each category: Bar Graph. 
The  predicted amount of return: Bar Graph.
